<h1>Griffin's Personal Movie List</h1>
<h2>My Top Three Favorite Movies</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Rurouni Kenshin: The Beginning</h3>
<p>I thoroughly enjoyed Rurouni Kenshin for the action and for it being a live action anime.</p>
<h3>Kill Boksoon</h3>
<p>Kill Boksoon has a very enticing story about a mother who is actually apart of a secret society and an assassin.</p>
<h3>Believer</h3>
<p>Believer is a movie about a burnt out detective in pursuit of a drug kingpin who hides his identity. 
    Luckily for the detective he gets a break when a survivor from a factory explosion decides to help.</p>
